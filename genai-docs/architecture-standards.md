# Architecture Document Standards

Architecture documents provide a high-level, holistic view of the system's structure, components, and their interactions. They are living documents that evolve with the system. This standard emphasizes a problem-focused, value-driven approach to architectural decisions, ensuring clarity and understanding for all stakeholders.

## Architecture Document File Naming Convention

Architecture documents are typically stored in the `docs/architecture/` directory.

**Path:** `docs/architecture/{kebab-case-title}.md`

## Architecture Document Content Template

```markdown

## 1. Introduction
{A brief overview of the system or the specific architectural area this document covers. State its purpose and scope, emphasizing its contribution to business value and the problems it solves.}

## 2. Business and System Context
{Describe how this system or architectural component fits into the larger business ecosystem. Explain the relevant business processes, functions, and value streams it supports. Detail its interactions with other applications and services. Use C4 model diagrams where appropriate, explicitly linking technical components to business value.}

## 3. Architectural Drivers
{List the key quality attributes (e.g., scalability, security, performance, maintainability) and constraints that influenced the architectural decisions. Clearly articulate how these drivers relate to business objectives and value delivery.}

## 4. Architectural Decisions
{Summarize the most significant architectural decisions made. For detailed rationale, refer to specific ADRs, highlighting how each decision addresses a problem and contributes to overall system value.}

## 5. Logical View
{Describe the system's logical organization, including modules, layers, and their relationships. Detail how these map to underlying technology services and components. Use diagrams to illustrate, focusing on how logical structures support business functions and value delivery.}

## 6. Process View
{Illustrate the runtime behavior of the system, including interactions between business processes, applications, and technology. Describe data flows, event handling, and concurrency aspects, emphasizing the flow of value and identifying potential bottlenecks.}

## 7. Deployment View
{Describe how the system is deployed, including infrastructure, environments, and deployment strategies. Detail the mapping of application components to technology infrastructure.}

## 8. Data View
{Outline the main data entities, their relationships, and persistence mechanisms. Connect data to the business objects they represent and the applications that manage them.}

## 9. Security Considerations
{Detail the security measures and considerations applied to the architecture, linking them to the protection of business assets and value.}

## 10. Operational Considerations
{Describe how the system will be monitored, managed, and maintained in production, focusing on how these activities ensure continuous value delivery and address potential operational bottlenecks.}

## 11. Future Considerations
{Discuss known limitations, potential future enhancements, or areas for further investigation, framed in terms of future value creation and problem resolution.}

## 12. Related Documents
{Links to relevant ADRs, design specs, or other documentation.}

## Document Granularity and Organization

To ensure clarity and prevent information overload, architecture documentation should be broken down into focused, manageable files. The goal is to abstract layers so that readers can focus on the specific details they need without being overwhelmed. Starting at any node in the documentation should not present too much information.

- **Overall System Architecture**: A high-level `overview.md` (like this template) should provide the entry point, summarizing the entire system.
- **Specific Architectural Concerns**: Dedicated Markdown files should be created for specific architectural views or concerns (e.g., `data-flow.md`, `security-considerations.md`, `deployment-model.md`). These files should elaborate on the relevant sections from the `overview.md`.
- **Submodule/Project-Specific Architecture**: For larger projects or monorepos, consider creating subdirectories within `docs/architecture/` for each major submodule or project. Each subdirectory would then contain its own `overview.md` and specific architectural concern documents relevant to that submodule.
- **Cross-referencing**: Ensure robust cross-referencing between documents to allow readers to navigate from high-level overviews to detailed views and vice-versa.
