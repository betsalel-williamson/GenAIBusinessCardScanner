- **As a** Business Analyst,
- **I want to** reliably process business card data, even when the format changes or some information is missing, and easily export the results to a location of my choice,
- **so that** I can consistently access accurate and complete business contact information for analysis and outreach, without worrying about data errors or manual data handling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system successfully processes all business card data files, regardless of minor variations in their content (e.g., missing fields).
- I can specify where the processed business card data is saved as a CSV file.
- The exported CSV file contains all available and correctly structured business card information.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: 100% of valid business card data files are successfully processed and exported without manual intervention.
- **Secondary Metrics**: User satisfaction with the flexibility of export options.
