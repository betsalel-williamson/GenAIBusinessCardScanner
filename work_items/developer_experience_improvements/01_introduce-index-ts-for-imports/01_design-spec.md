## 1. Objective

This design aims to standardize module imports by introducing `index.ts` (or `index.js`) files in directories to create cleaner and more maintainable import paths.

## 2. Technical Design

For directories containing multiple related modules, an `index.ts` file will be created to re-export these modules. Consumers will then import directly from the directory, rather than specifying individual file paths.

## 3. Key Changes

### 3.1. API Contracts

No API contract changes.

### 3.2. Data Models

No data model changes.

### 3.3. Component Responsibilities

- **Existing module files**: Will be re-exported from a new `index.ts` file within their directory.
- **Consumer files**: Import paths will be updated to reference the directory instead of the specific module file.

## 4. Alternatives Considered

- **Direct file imports**: Rejected due to verbose and brittle import paths, especially when files are moved within a directory.
- **Barrel files (manual)**: This design is essentially a formalized approach to barrel files.

## 5. Out of Scope

- Automatic generation of `index.ts` files (manual creation and maintenance).
- Refactoring of all existing imports in a single pass (will be done incrementally).
