## Task

Introduce `index.ts` files in selected directories to simplify module import paths and improve code organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] An `index.ts` file is created in at least one target directory (e.g., `src/client/components/`).
- [ ] The `index.ts` file re-exports modules from its directory.
- [ ] All consumers of the re-exported modules are updated to import from the directory path (e.g., `import { ComponentA } from './components'` instead of `import { ComponentA } from './components/ComponentA'`).
- [ ] Type-checking passes after changes.
- [ ] All tests pass after changes.
