**Description:**

Create a new React component in the `validation_tool.ts` project that allows users to select and upload multiple PDF files. This component will display the selected files and their upload status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A new file `src/components/FileUpload.tsx` is created.
- The component allows users to select one or more PDF files from their local machine.
- The selected files are displayed in a list before uploading.
- An "Upload" button initiates the upload process.
- The component displays the upload status for each file (e.g., "Uploading", "Complete", "Error").
