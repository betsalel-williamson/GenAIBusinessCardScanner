## Task

Integrate the Trivy vulnerability scanner into the GitHub Actions CI workflow for the `validation_tool.ts` Docker image, ensuring that critical and high-severity vulnerabilities cause the build to fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file is updated to include a Trivy scan step in the `node-ci` job.
- [ ] The Trivy scan uses `aquasecurity/trivy-action` to scan the `validation-webapp` Docker image.
- [ ] The scan is configured to fail the CI build if `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` severity vulnerabilities are detected.
- [ ] Trivy scan results are visible in the GitHub Actions workflow logs.
- [ ] (Optional) Trivy is configured to generate SARIF reports for GitHub Security integration.
