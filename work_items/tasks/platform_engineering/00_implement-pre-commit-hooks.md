## Task

Implement the `pre-commit` framework in the monorepo by creating a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root and configuring initial hooks for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Markdown.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pre-commit` is added as a development dependency (e.g., to `requirements-dev.txt` if applicable).
- [ ] A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file exists at the repository root.
- [ ] The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes at least one hook for Python (e.g., `ruff`).
- [ ] The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes at least one hook for TypeScript/JavaScript (e.g., `eslint` or `prettier`).
- [ ] The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes at least one hook for Markdown (e.g., `markdownlint-cli2`).
- [ ] Running `pre-commit install` successfully sets up the Git hooks.
- [ ] Running `git commit` triggers the configured `pre-commit` hooks.
