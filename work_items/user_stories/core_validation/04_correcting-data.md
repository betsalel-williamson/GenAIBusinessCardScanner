- **As a** Data Operator,
- **I want to** edit any extracted data field, add new fields that the AI may have missed, and delete irrelevant fields,
- **so that** I can ensure the final data record is 100% accurate and complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All text fields are editable.
- An "Add Field" button allows me to create a new key-value pair.
- A list of expected fields is displayed to minimize the addition of new columns.
- My changes are automatically saved as a draft in the background.
- The UI clearly indicates the autosave status ("Saving...", "Draft Saved").

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: Time to correct a record with 3-5 errors is under 60 seconds.
- **Secondary Metrics**: Number of fields added per record is less than 2 on average.
