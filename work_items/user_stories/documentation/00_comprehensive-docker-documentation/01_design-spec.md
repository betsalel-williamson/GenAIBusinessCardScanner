## 1. Objective

To provide comprehensive and accessible documentation for Docker image building and publishing within the monorepo, enabling new developers to quickly understand and contribute to the containerization strategy, and ensuring consistent and optimized image creation.

## 2. Technical Design

The documentation will be a new Markdown file, `genai-docs/docker-guide.md`, serving as a central reference for all Docker-related practices within the monorepo. It will cover the multi-stage build strategy, the purpose and usage of base images, local development workflows, and integration with GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

### 2.1. Document Structure

The `docker-guide.md` will be structured logically, starting with an overview and progressing to detailed instructions and best practices.

### 2.2. Content Areas

* **Introduction to Docker in the Monorepo:** Explain the rationale behind using Docker and the monorepo's multi-stage build approach.
* **Base Image Strategy:** Detail the purpose and usage of `Dockerfile.base` (Node.js) and any future Python base images. Provide instructions on when and how to update these base images.
* **Project-Specific Dockerfiles:** Explain the structure and best practices for `validation_tool.ts/Dockerfile` and other project-specific Dockerfiles.
* **Local Development Workflow:** Provide clear instructions for building and running Docker images locally.
* **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) Integration:** Document the process for authenticating, tagging, and pushing images to GHCR via CI/CD.
* **Docker Image Hardening and Optimization:** Summarize key best practices for creating secure and efficient Docker images (e.g., non-root users, minimal base images, `.dockerignore`, dependency pruning).

## 3. Key Changes

### 3.1. API Contracts

No changes to API contracts are required.

### 3.2. Data Models

No changes to data models are required.

### 3.3. Component Responsibilities

* **`genai-docs/docker-guide.md`:** New documentation file.
* **Developers:** Will be expected to follow the guidelines outlined in the documentation.

## 4. Alternatives Considered

* **Scattered Documentation:** Rejected to avoid fragmentation and ensure a single source of truth for Docker practices.
* **No Dedicated Documentation:** Rejected as it would hinder developer onboarding and lead to inconsistent practices.

## 5. Out of Scope

* Detailed Docker tutorials (assumes basic Docker knowledge).
* Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline configuration details (will be covered in CI/CD specific documentation).
* Deployment strategies (e.g., Kubernetes, ECS) beyond image publishing.
