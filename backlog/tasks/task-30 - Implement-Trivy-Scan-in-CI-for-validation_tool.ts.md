## Description

Integrate the Trivy vulnerability scanner into the GitHub Actions CI workflow for the validation_tool.ts Docker image, ensuring that critical and high-severity vulnerabilities cause the build to fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The .github/workflows/ci.yml file is updated to include a Trivy scan step in the node-ci job
- [ ] The Trivy scan uses aquasecurity/trivy-action to scan the validation-webapp Docker image
- [ ] The scan is configured to fail the CI build if CRITICAL or HIGH severity vulnerabilities are detected
- [ ] Trivy scan results are visible in the GitHub Actions workflow logs
- [ ] (Optional) Trivy is configured to generate SARIF reports for GitHub Security integration.
