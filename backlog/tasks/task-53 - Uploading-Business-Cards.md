## Description

As a Data Operator, I want to upload one or more PDF business cards through the web interface, so that they can be queued for AI processing without me needing to access the server's file system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The homepage displays a file upload area
- [ ] I can select multiple PDF files at once
- [ ] The UI provides clear feedback for each file's upload status
- [ ] Successfully uploaded PDFs are stored in the image_data_source directory.
