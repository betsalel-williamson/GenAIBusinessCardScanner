## Description

- **As a** user of the business card validation application, - **I want to** be confident that my submitted data is processed by a secure system, - **so that** I can trust the application with sensitive information and rely on its continuous availability. ## Metrics for Success - **Primary Metric**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities reported in production images. - **Secondary Metrics**: Number of security incidents related to application vulnerabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Docker images deployed to production have undergone automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities are prevented from reaching production
- [ ] Security scan results are transparently available (e.g.
- [ ] via audit logs or reports).
