## Description

Migrate the test files from the src/__tests__ directory to be co-located with the files they are testing. For example, src/src/__tests__components/FileUpload.test.tsx should be moved to src/client/components/FileUpload.test.tsx.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All test files are moved to be next to the files they are testing
- [ ] The src/__tests__ directory is removed
- [ ] All tests pass after the migration.
