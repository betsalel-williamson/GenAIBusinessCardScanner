## Description

Introduce index.ts files in selected directories to simplify module import paths and improve code organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] An index.ts file is created in at least one target directory (e.g.
- [ ] src/client/components/)
- [ ] The index.ts file re-exports modules from its directory
- [ ] All consumers of the re-exported modules are updated to import from the directory path (e.g.
- [ ] import { ComponentA } from './components' instead of import { ComponentA } from './components/ComponentA')
- [ ] Type-checking passes after changes
- [ ] All tests pass after changes.
