## Description

- **As a** Marketing Manager, - **I want** the system to use our Google Sheet as the single source of truth for contacts, - **so that** I can easily manage the outreach list in a familiar tool. ## Acceptance Criteria - The system can securely connect to a specified Google Sheet and read its contents. - The contact list, including names, emails, and outreach status, is successfully parsed from the sheet. - The connection details (e.g., sheet ID, credentials path) are configurable and not hard-coded. ## Metrics for Success - **Primary Metric**: 100% of contacts marked for outreach in the Google Sheet are successfully retrieved by the system. - **Secondary Metrics**: Any changes made to the contact list in the Google Sheet are reflected in the system on the next run.
