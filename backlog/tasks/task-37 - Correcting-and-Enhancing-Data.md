## Description

- **As a** Data Operator, - **I want to** edit any extracted data field, add new fields that the AI may have missed, and delete irrelevant fields, - **so that** I can ensure the final data record is 100% accurate and complete. ## Metrics for Success - **Primary Metric**: Time to correct a record with 3-5 errors is under 60 seconds. - **Secondary Metrics**: Number of fields added per record is less than 2 on average.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All text fields are editable
- [ ] An "Add Field" button allows me to create a new key-value pair
- [ ] A list of expected fields is displayed to minimize the addition of new columns
- [ ] My changes are automatically saved as a draft in the background
- [ ] The UI clearly indicates the autosave status ("Saving..."
- [ ] "Draft Saved").
