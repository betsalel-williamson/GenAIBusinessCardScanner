## Description

Add unit tests for the filter_contacts asset to ensure it correctly filters the contact list.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new test file is created (e.g.
- [ ] dagster_project/tests/test_email_outreach_assets.py)
- [ ] The tests use a sample contact list as input
- [ ] The tests verify that the asset correctly identifies contacts to be included and excluded based on the filter criteria
- [ ] The tests verify that the asset handles an empty input list gracefully.
