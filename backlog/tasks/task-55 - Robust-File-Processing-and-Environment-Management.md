## Description

- **As a** data pipeline operator, - **I want to** ensure that processed business card files are not re-processed and that I can manage distinct development and local production Dagster environments, - **so that** data integrity is maintained and deployment workflows are clear and reliable. ## Acceptance Criteria - The system must prevent re-processing of already processed files. - The local development Dagster environment must remain ephemeral and clean for testing. - The local production Dagster environment must be persistent and allow for code updates without data loss. ## Metrics for Success - **Primary Metric**: Zero instances of duplicate file processing in the local production environment. - **Secondary Metrics**: Clear separation and easy switching between development and local production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The system must prevent re-processing of already processed files
- [ ] The local development Dagster environment must remain ephemeral and clean for testing
- [ ] The local production Dagster environment must be persistent and allow for code updates without data loss.
