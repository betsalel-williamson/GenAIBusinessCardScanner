## Description

As a Marketing Manager, I want to easily mark which contacts in our Google Sheet should receive an email, so that I have precise control over the outreach campaign.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The system can filter the full contact list based on a configurable column and value
- [ ] Only contacts with a designated value are included in the final outreach list
- [ ] The filtering logic is implemented as a Dagster asset.
