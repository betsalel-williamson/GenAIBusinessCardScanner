## Description

- **As a** Data Analyst, - **I want** a final, clean, and structured table in the database (e.g., dim_business_cards) that contains all the human-validated business card data, - **so that** I can confidently use this data for CRM imports, reporting, and business intelligence without needing to perform any further cleaning or parsing. ## Metrics for Success - **Primary Metric**: 100% of data in the final table conforms to the defined schema. - **Secondary Metrics**: Data analysts can access and use the final table with zero data cleaning steps required.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A dbt model exists that transforms the validated JSON data into a structured
- [ ] wide table
- [ ] The final table has correctly-typed columns (e.g.
- [ ] company as TEXT
- [ ] date_imported as DATE)
- [ ] This table is the single source of truth for all processed business card information.
