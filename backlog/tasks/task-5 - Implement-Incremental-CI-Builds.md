## Description

Refactor the CI/CD pipeline to support incremental builds and tests, running only affected tests and build steps based on changed files.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI workflow identifies changed files since the last successful build
- [ ] Only tests relevant to the changed files/modules are executed
- [ ] Build artifacts are generated only for changed components
- [ ] Overall CI pipeline execution time is reduced for small changes.
