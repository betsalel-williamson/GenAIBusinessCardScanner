## Description

- **As a** Marketing Manager, - **I want** the system to automatically update a contact's status in our Google Sheet after an email has been sent, - **so that** I have a real-time, accurate view of our campaign's progress. ## Metrics for Success - **Primary Metric**: 100% of contacts who are sent an email have their status updated to 'Sent' in the Google Sheet within 1 minute. - **Secondary Metrics**: No other data in the Google Sheet is accidentally modified.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The system can update a specific cell in the Google Sheet to mark a contact as 'Sent'
- [ ] The update operation is performed by a new method in the Google Sheets resource
- [ ] The system can identify the correct row to update based on a unique identifier (e.g.
- [ ] email address).
