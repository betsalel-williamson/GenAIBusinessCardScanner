- **As a** project developer,
- **I want to** manage the `genai-docs` content as a project dependency (npm/pip),
- **so that** I can easily integrate, update, and contribute to the shared documentation without the complexities of Git submodules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The project can install a dependency (npm/pip package) that provides CLI commands for `genai-docs` management.
- The CLI tool can initialize the `genai-docs` content in the local project from a central repository.
- The CLI tool can synchronize local `genai-docs` content with the central repository, pulling updates.
- The CLI tool can (optionally) push local modifications of `genai-docs` content back to the central repository, given appropriate access.
- The `genai-docs` content is committed to the local project's Git repository, making it available for AI tools.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: Reduction in developer effort/time spent on managing `genai-docs` synchronization (e.g., measured by survey or time tracking).
- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - Increased consistency of `genai-docs` across projects.
  - Higher rate of contributions/updates to `genai-docs` from consuming projects.
  - Elimination of Git submodule-related issues in projects.
