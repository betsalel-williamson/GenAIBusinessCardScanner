- **As a** Developer,
- **I want to** have a containerized version of the frontend application,
- **so that** I can ensure consistent development and deployment environments, and enable multi-platform builds.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A `Dockerfile` is created for the `validation_tool.ts` application.
- The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build to create a small, efficient production image.
- The `Dockerfile` uses `pnpm` for dependency management.
- A `.dockerignore` file is created to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker image.
- The `docker-compose.yml` file is updated to include a service for the frontend application.
- The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is added to the `.gitignore` in the `validation_tool.ts` directory.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: The frontend application can be successfully built and run using `docker-compose up --build`.
- **Secondary Metrics**: The resulting Docker image is smaller than 500MB.
