- **As a** Developer,
- **I want to** ensure that the server-side rendered HTML is properly hydrated on the client,
- **so that** the application becomes fully interactive without any flickering or loss of state.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system must render the initial HTML on the server.
- The client-side JavaScript must successfully hydrate the server-rendered HTML.
- There should be no visible flickering or content shift during the hydration process.
- The application must be fully interactive after hydration.
- A test exists to verify that a component is rendered on the server and then successfully hydrated on the client.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: A new Playwright test for SSR hydration passes successfully.
- **Secondary Metrics**: None.
