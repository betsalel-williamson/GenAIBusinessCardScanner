## Task

Establish a process and create a document to record accepted vulnerabilities and their mitigation strategies, particularly for non-critical issues identified by Trivy scans.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The document includes a template for recording vulnerability details (CVE, severity, package), rationale for acceptance/mitigation, and mitigation steps.
- [ ] The process for updating this document is clear.
