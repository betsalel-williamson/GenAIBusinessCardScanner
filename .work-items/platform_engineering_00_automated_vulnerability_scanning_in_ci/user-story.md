- **As a** user of the business card validation application,
- **I want to** be confident that my submitted data is processed by a secure system,
- **so that** I can trust the application with sensitive information and rely on its continuous availability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Docker images deployed to production have undergone automated vulnerability scanning.
- [ ] Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities are prevented from reaching production.
- [ ] Security scan results are transparently available (e.g., via audit logs or reports).

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities reported in production images.
- **Secondary Metrics**: Number of security incidents related to application vulnerabilities.
