- **As a** Marketing Manager,
- **I want** the system to automatically update a contact's status in our Google Sheet after an email has been sent,
- **so that** I have a real-time, accurate view of our campaign's progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system can update a specific cell in the Google Sheet to mark a contact as 'Sent'.
- The update operation is performed by a new method in the Google Sheets resource.
- The system can identify the correct row to update based on a unique identifier (e.g., email address).

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: 100% of contacts who are sent an email have their status updated to 'Sent' in the Google Sheet within 1 minute.
- **Secondary Metrics**: No other data in the Google Sheet is accidentally modified.
