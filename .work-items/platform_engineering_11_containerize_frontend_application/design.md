## 1. Objective

To containerize the frontend application (`validation_tool.ts`) using Docker, providing a consistent environment for development and deployment, and enabling multi-platform builds.

## 2. Technical Design

A multi-stage `Dockerfile` will be created in the `validation_tool.ts` directory. This will ensure the final production image is as small as possible, containing only the necessary build artifacts and production dependencies.

- **Base Image**: `node:20-slim`
- **Dependency Management**: `pnpm`
- **Build Stages**:
  - `base`: Installs `pnpm`.
  - `deps`: Installs production dependencies.
  - `builder`: Builds the client and server.
  - `production`: The final, small production image.

A `.dockerignore` file will be added to the `validation_tool.ts` directory to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.

The existing `docker-compose.yml` in the project root will be updated to include a `frontend` service. This service will use the new `Dockerfile` and expose the application's port (7456).

Finally, `pnpm-lock.yaml` will be added to the `.gitignore` in the `validation_tool.ts` directory to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

## 3. Key Changes

### 3.1. API Contracts

No API changes.

### 3.2. Data Models

No data model changes.

### 3.3. Component Responsibilities

- **`validation_tool.ts/Dockerfile`**: A new file that defines the Docker image for the frontend application.
- **`validation_tool.ts/.dockerignore`**: A new file that specifies which files to exclude from the Docker build context.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: The existing file will be modified to include a new `frontend` service.
- **`validation_tool.ts/.gitignore`**: The existing file will be modified to ignore `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## 4. Alternatives Considered

- **Single-stage Dockerfile**: This would result in a larger image, as it would include all build-time dependencies. The multi-stage approach is preferred for creating a smaller, more secure production image.

## 5. Out of Scope

- This design does not cover setting up a CI/CD pipeline for building and pushing the Docker image to a registry.
- This design does not cover containerizing any other services in the project.
