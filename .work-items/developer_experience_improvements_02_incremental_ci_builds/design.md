## 1. Objective

This design aims to optimize CI/CD pipelines by implementing incremental builds and tests, ensuring that only changed components and their dependents are re-tested or re-built.

## 2. Technical Design

Leverage Git history and potentially build tools' capabilities to identify changed files and their impact. This will involve using tools or scripts that can determine affected modules/packages and then selectively run tests or build steps only for those components.

## 3. Key Changes

### 3.1. API Contracts

No API contract changes.

### 3.2. Data Models

No data model changes.

### 3.3. Component Responsibilities

- **CI/CD Workflow Files (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)**: Will be modified to include logic for detecting changes and conditionally executing build/test steps.
- **Build Scripts**: May need to be enhanced to support incremental operations or to accept parameters for selective execution.

## 4. Alternatives Considered

- **Full rebuild/retest on every commit**: Rejected due to long CI times and inefficient resource usage, especially in a growing monorepo.

## 5. Out of Scope

- Implementing a full-fledged distributed build system.
- Optimizing deployment strategies (focus is on build and test phases).
