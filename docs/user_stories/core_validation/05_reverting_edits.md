# Story 5: Reverting Incorrect Edits

* **As a** Data Operator,
* **I want to** be able to revert a single field back to its original AI-extracted value,
* **so that** I can quickly undo a specific mistake without losing other corrections I've made to the record.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Each field has a "Revert" button.
* Clicking "Revert" restores only that field's value to what the AI originally provided.
* The system also supports a global undo/redo for my session edits.
