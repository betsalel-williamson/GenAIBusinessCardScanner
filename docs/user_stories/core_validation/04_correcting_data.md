# Story 4: Correcting and Enhancing Data

* **As a** Data Operator,
* **I want to** edit any extracted data field, add new fields that the AI may have missed, and delete irrelevant fields,
* **so that** I can ensure the final data record is 100% accurate and complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

* All text fields are editable.
* An "Add Field" button allows me to create a new key-value pair.
* A list of expected fields is displayed to minimize the addition of new columns
* My changes are automatically saved as a draft in the background.
* The UI clearly indicates the autosave status ("Saving...", "Draft Saved").
