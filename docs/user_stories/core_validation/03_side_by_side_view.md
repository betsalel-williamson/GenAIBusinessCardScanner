# Story 3: Side-by-Side Validation View

* **As a** Data Operator,
* **I want to** view a business card's PDF image and its AI-extracted data fields side-by-side,
* **so that** I can efficiently compare the source document to the transcribed data.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The PDF is rendered clearly in one pane.
* I can pan and zoom the PDF to inspect details.
* The AI-extracted data is displayed as an editable form in another pane.
* The layout is clean and responsive.
