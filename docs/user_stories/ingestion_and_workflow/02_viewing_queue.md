# Story 2: Viewing the Work Queue

* **As a** Data Operator,
* **I want to** see a list of all business cards in the system and their real-time status (e.g., "Processing with AI", "Needs Validation", "Validated", "Complete"),
* **so that** I can understand the overall progress and select a card to work on.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The homepage displays a list or table of all individual records.
* Each record shows a unique identifier and its current status.
* The list updates automatically or with a refresh to show newly processed cards.
* I can filter the list to show only records that require my attention ("Needs Validation").
* On the validating page, we show a simple, minimal progress bar at the bottom of the page, with a tooltip with details.
