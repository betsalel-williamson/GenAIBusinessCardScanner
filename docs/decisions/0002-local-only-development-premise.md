## Context

The project is currently in its initial development phase. There is a need to define the scope of deployment and infrastructure considerations to guide development efforts and resource allocation.

## Decision

We will focus development efforts on a **local-only deployment premise** using Docker Compose. This means that all architectural decisions, infrastructure choices, and development practices will prioritize ease of setup, development, and testing on a single developer's machine.

## Alternatives Considered

* **Cloud-Native Deployment from Inception**: Developing with a full cloud-native deployment (e.g., Kubernetes, managed cloud services) as the immediate target.
  * **Pros**: Aligns early with production environment, potentially reducing refactoring later.
  * **Cons**: Significantly increases initial complexity, setup time, and learning curve. Requires more resources (cloud accounts, advanced DevOps knowledge) upfront. Over-engineering for the current stage.

## Consequences

* **Positive**:
  * **Accelerated Development**: Simplifies the development environment, allowing developers to iterate faster and focus on core application logic.
  * **Reduced Overhead**: Minimizes the need for complex infrastructure setup, cloud accounts, and advanced CI/CD pipelines in the early stages.
  * **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Easier for new contributors to get the project running locally.
  * **Cost-Effective**: No immediate cloud infrastructure costs.
* **Negative**:
  * **Future Refactoring**: A transition to a production-grade, externally hosted environment will require significant architectural changes, refactoring, and additional development effort in the future (e.g., moving from SQLite/DuckDB to a centralized database, implementing robust object storage, advanced monitoring, scaling solutions).
  * **Less Production-like Environment**: The local environment will not fully replicate the complexities and challenges of a distributed, cloud-hosted system.
* **Neutral**:
  * **Scalability and Resilience**: These concerns will be addressed primarily at the application level for local performance, with full production-grade solutions deferred.

This decision prioritizes rapid initial development and ease of local iteration, acknowledging that a future phase will involve a significant effort to transition to a production-ready, externally hosted architecture.
