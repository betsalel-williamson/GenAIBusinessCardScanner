# Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations for the local development environment.

## 1. Secure Development Practices

- **Secure Coding**: Adhere to secure coding principles to minimize vulnerabilities in the application logic.
- **Input Validation**: Implement robust input validation to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) even in a local context.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update and scan third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Least Privilege (Local)**: When configuring local services, grant only the necessary permissions to avoid accidental exposure.

## 2. Local Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Avoid storing sensitive production data in local development environments. Use mock or synthetic data where possible.
- **Local Credentials**: Manage local database and service credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables, `.env` files not committed to version control).
- **Shared Volume Access**: Ensure that the shared Docker volume for file storage is configured with appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access within the local environment.

## 3. Local Authentication and Authorization

- **Development Authentication**: Use simplified authentication mechanisms for local development (e.g., mock users, basic auth) that are clearly distinct from production systems.
- **Local Access Control**: Ensure that local development instances are not inadvertently exposed to the public internet.

## 4. Local Logging and Debugging

- **Informative Logging**: Log security-relevant events for local debugging and development purposes.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data in Logs**: Do not log sensitive user data or credentials in plain text, even in local logs.

## 5. Current State

- Security practices are currently focused on preventing common vulnerabilities through secure coding and input validation within `validation_tool.ts`.
- Local data is stored in SQLite and DuckDB files, which are typically not exposed externally.

## 6. Immediate Goals

- Ensure all sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys for Google Generative AI, Postmark) are managed securely using environment variables and not hardcoded.
- Implement basic authentication/authorization for the `validation_tool.ts` API if not already present.

## 7. Future Considerations

- **Comprehensive Authentication/Authorization**: Implement robust authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) and role-based access control (RBAC) for production.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit for production environments.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Establish regular security audits, penetration testing, and automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines for production.
- **Threat Modeling**: Conduct formal threat modeling for the entire system to identify and mitigate potential attack vectors.
